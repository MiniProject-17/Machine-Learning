# Logistic Regression 

This repository demonstrates **Logistic Regression** using both single-variable and multiple-variable approaches.

## Overview

### Single-Variable Logistic Regression
- Logistic regression applied to a dataset with one feature.
- Focuses on binary classification using a single predictor.
- Includes steps for training the model, visualizing decision boundaries, and evaluating performance.

### Multiple-Variable Logistic Regression (Iris Dataset)
- Logistic regression applied to the **Iris dataset** using multiple features.
- Handles multiclass classification (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).
- Model evaluation includes accuracy, confusion matrix, and multiclass strategies like **One-vs-Rest**.

## Requirements

To run the code, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
