## Introduction

Mumbai experiences diverse rainfall patterns, which significantly impact the cityâ€™s environment and infrastructure. This analysis aims to understand these patterns through various data analysis techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## Basics of NumPy

NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a variety of mathematical functions. Key features include:

- **N-dimensional arrays**: Efficiently store and manipulate large datasets.
- **Mathematical functions**: Perform operations on arrays without explicit loops.

## Basics of Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. Key features include:

- **DataFrames**: Two-dimensional, size-mutable, and potentially heterogeneous tabular data structures.
- **Data manipulation**: Functions for merging, reshaping, and aggregating datasets.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Before analysis, the dataset undergoes several cleaning steps, including:

- **Handling missing values**: Filling or removing missing data points.
- **Removing duplicates**: Ensuring each entry is unique.
- **Data type conversion**: Ensuring data types are appropriate for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to uncover patterns and insights in the data. Key techniques include:

- **Summary statistics**: Descriptive statistics to understand data distributions.
- **Correlation analysis**: Identifying relationships between different variables.

## Data Visualization

Visualization is crucial for interpreting data. This project uses:

- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and visual representation of data.
- **Seaborn**: For creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

Examples include:

- Line plots to show rainfall trends over time.
- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between various features.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into Mumbai's rainfall patterns, helping to understand trends and potential implications. The methodologies applied here can be extended to other datasets for broader applications.
